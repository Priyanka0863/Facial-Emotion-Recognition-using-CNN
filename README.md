A deep learning project that classifies facial expressions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) from grayscale images using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training with Keras callbacks, and performance evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report.
